## <b>About me</b>
##### Hi there 👋,
##### Just a few lines to introduce myself. Back in the late '80s, I was lucky to have a Sinclair 2048 Timex and ZX Spectrum +. That was when I was introduced to the world of personal computers. Besides games, I had the chance to get to know a programming language called Basic. That was my first experience with programming.<br>
##### My professional life took another course, I have mostly been a clerk, and also worked as a IT support in two companies. In the last company i worked for, i had the chance to do some SQL programming. I enjoyed that part of programming!<br>
##### In 2016, I decided to upgrade myself in computer technologies. I got certified as a computer technician, which also included the principles of computer languages such as C, C++, Java, SQL, Javascript, CSS and also the markup language HTML.
##### In 2023, I decided to take a new step and applied to 42 School at Porto to deepen my programming skills.
## <b>42 Common Core</b>
##### I started my programming learning path at 42 Porto School, when I decided to take my chance by doing the online test, which was followed by a one-month piscine where i had projects to complete. I had to learn with my peers, to evaluate them, and be evaluated by them. I was lucky to be one of the pisciners who managed to join the 42 Student Community.

##### So far I have completed the following projects, which you can check out on my github. 
##### 👉 Libft ✔ ft_printf ✔ get_next_line ✔ born2beroot ✔ push_swap ✔ minitalk ✔ so_long ✔ Philosophers ✔ Minishell ✔ NetPractice ✔ Cub3d ✔ CPP00 ✔ CPP01 ✔ CPP02 ✔ CPP03 ✔ CPP04 ✔ CPP05 ✔ CPP06 ⏳ CPP07 ✘ CPP08 ✘ CPP09 ✘ Inception ⏳ ft_irc ✘ ft_transcendence ✘

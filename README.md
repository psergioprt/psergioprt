##### Hi there 👋,
##### I've started my programming learning path in 2023, when i decided to dive in the 42 Porto Programming School. I took my change doing the on-line test, followed by one month piscine where i had to learn with my peers, evaluate and be evaluated by them. I had the luck to be one of the pisciners who managed to join the 42 Student Community.
##### Since October 2023, i have done the following projects, which you can check here in github.
#### 👉 Libft
#### 👉 ft_printf
#### 👉 get_next_line
#### 👉 borntoberoot
#### 👉 push_swap </p>
#### 👉 minitalk </p>

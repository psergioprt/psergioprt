##### Hi there 👋,
I've started my programming learning path at 42 Porto School, when I decided to take my change by doing the online test, which was followed by a one-month piscine where i had projects to make. I had to learn with my peers, to evaluate them, and be evaluated by them. I was luck to be one of the pisciners who managed to join the 42 Student Community.
##### So far I have done the following projects, which you can check out on my github.
#### 👉 Libft 👈
#### 👉 ft_printf 👈
#### 👉 get_next_line 👈
#### 👉 borntoberoot 👈
#### 👉 push_swap 👈
#### 👉 minitalk 👈

#### Currently i am 👷‍♂️ on so_long project

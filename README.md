## <b>About me</b>
##### Hi there 👋,
##### Back in the late 1980s, I was fortunate to have a Sinclair Timex 2048 and a ZX Spectrum +, which introduced me to the world of personal computers. Beyond playing games, I discovered Basic, my first programming language, and had my initial experience with programming.<br>
##### My professional path took a different course, as I have mostly worked as a clerk, with some experience in IT support at two companies. In my most recent role, I had the opportunity to work with SQL programming, which I particularly enjoyed.<br>
##### In 2016, I decided to upgrade my skills in computer technologies. I became a certified computer technician, gaining foundational knowledge in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, as well as the markup language HTML.
##### In 2023, I decided to take a new step in my career and applied to 42 School in Porto to further develop my programming skills.
## <b>42 Common Core</b>
##### I began my programming journey at 42 Porto School, starting with the online test and followed by a one-month piscine, during which I had several projects to complete. I learned collaboratively with my peers, evaluated their work, and was evaluated in turn. I was fortunate to be among the pisciners who successfully joined the 42 Student Community.

##### So far I have completed the following projects, which you can check out on my github. 
##### 👉 Libft ✔ ft_printf ✔ get_next_line ✔ born2beroot ✔ push_swap ✔ minitalk ✔ so_long ✔ Philosophers ✔ Minishell ✔ NetPractice ✔ Cub3d ✔ CPP00 ✔ CPP01 ✔ CPP02 ✔ CPP03 ✔ CPP04 ✔ CPP05 ✔ CPP06 ✔ CPP07 ⏳ CPP08 ✘ CPP09 ✘ Inception ⏳ ft_irc ✘ ft_transcendence ✘

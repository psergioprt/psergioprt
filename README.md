##### Hi there ğŸ‘‹,
I've started my programming learning path in 2023, when I decided to dive in the 42 Porto Programming School. I took my change by doing the online test, followed by a one-month piscine where I had to learn with my peers, to evaluate them, and be evaluated by them. I was luck to be one of the pisciners who managed to join the 42 Student Community.
##### Since October 2023, I have done the following projects, which you can check out on my github.
#### ğŸ‘‰ Libft
#### ğŸ‘‰ ft_printf
#### ğŸ‘‰ get_next_line
#### ğŸ‘‰ borntoberoot
#### ğŸ‘‰ push_swap </p>
#### ğŸ‘‰ minitalk </p>

## <b>About me</b>
##### Hi there 👋,
##### Just a few lines to introduce myself. Back on late 80's, i was lucky to have a Timex 2048 and a few years later a Sinclair ZX Spectrum +. That when I was introduced to the world of the personal computers. Besides games, I had the change to get to know a programming language called Basic. That was my first experience of programming.<br>
##### My professional life took another course, I have been mostly a clerk, also as a IT support in two companies i have worked. In the last company i worked, i had the chance to do some SQL programming. I have enjoied that part of programming!<br>
##### In 2016 decided to upgrade myself in computer technologies. I got certificated as a computer technician, which also included the principles of computer languages such as C, C++, Java, SQL, Javascript, CSS and also the Markup Language, html.
##### In 2023 i have decided to take a new step. Applying to 42 School at Porto....
## <b>42 Common Core</b>
##### I've started my programming learning path at 42 Porto School, when I decided to take my change by doing the online test, which was followed by a one-month piscine where i had projects to make. I had to learn with my peers, to evaluate them, and be evaluated by them. I was luck to be one of the pisciners who managed to join the 42 Student Community.

##### So far I have done the following projects, which you can check out on my github.
##### 👉 Libft 👉 ft_printf 👉 get_next_line 👉 borntoberoot 👉 push_swap 👉 minitalk
##### Currently i am 👷‍♂️ on so_long project
